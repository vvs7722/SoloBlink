# SoloBlink  
**A Privacy-First, Single-Tab Browser Built on Chromium**

SoloBlink is a minimalist web browser designed for speed and privacy. Powered by the Chromium engine (Blink), it strips away the bloat: no cookies, no multiple tabs, just a lean, focused browsing experience. If you want a fast, no-tracking alternative to mainstream browsers, SoloBlink’s got you covered.

## Features  
- **Chromium Backend**: Uses the Blink rendering engine for reliable, modern browsing.  
- **No Cookies**: Zero cookie storage means no tracking, period.  
- **Single-Tab Design**: One tab at a time keeps it lightweight and lightning-fast.  
- **Bare-Bones Interface**: Basic features, no fluff—built for simplicity.  

## Why SoloBlink?  
Most browsers are weighed down by trackers, cookies, and tab overload. SoloBlink flips that—privacy and performance come first. It’s perfect for users who want a clean slate every session and don’t need the chaos of multi-tabbing.
